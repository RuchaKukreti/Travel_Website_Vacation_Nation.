			<h2>Dead Sea, Israel</h2>
		<p>The dark blue waters of the Dead Sea touch the borders of both Jordan and Israel. Actually a lake despite its name, the Dead Sea sits at the lowest land elevation on Earth–over 430 meters below sea level. With a salt concentration of around 31 percent–almost 10 times saltier than the ocean –the Dead Sea is so thick, nothing can sink into it, and everyone who walks into it will naturally float.

While the coastline around the lake has become a flourishing spa and resort destination, there is also a large influx of religious tourism in the area. Jericho, the city where Jesus is said to have healed blind beggars, is located just minutes northwest of the Dead Sea–and a number of other cities, including the legendary Sodom and Gomorra, as well as Zoar and Admah, are also located in this area. The area boasts some of the oldest inhabited cities in the world</p>

			<h2>Phuket,Thailand</h2>
		<p>Thailand's biggest island is also a magnet for visitors–and for good reason. Phuket boasts some of the best beaches in the country, with clean, soft, rolling sands and turquoise waters as far as the eye can see.

Kata, Hat Karon, and Kamala beaches see a lot of tourists during the high season (November to February) but remain sleepy little villages once the rains arrive. Beautiful coral reefs line up the coastline, offering amazing opportunities for snorkeling and diving but also sea kayaking and island hopping.

In between hours of lying under the sun, visitors can head to the white and gold Wat Chalong, the largest and most important Buddhist temple on the island, or climb up a hill to reach the Big Buddha–a 45-meter-tall statue covered with Burmese marble </p>

			<h2>Beijing, China</h2>
		<p>One of the most populous cities in the world, Beijing is also one of the oldest. You can get a peek into that history by walking the hutongs of Beijing, the narrow alleyways lined up with traditional homes and courtyards.

China's capital is home to seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the Imperial Summer Palace and its gardens, the oldest canal in the world, and the Forbidden City–a palace complex that served as the home of China's emperors for 500 years starting in the 1420s. The Forbidden City–made up of almost 1,000 different buildings–is one of Beijing's most impressive tourist attractions.

The city also offers visitors many unique-looking pagodas and temples, including the 12th-century, eight-sided Tianning Temple, as well as almost 150 museums and galleries. </p>

			<h2>Hanoi, Vietnam</h2>
		<p>Most visitors arriving in Vietnam land in either Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, or head straight to Halong Bay and the beach–but Vietnam's best place to visit is actually a well-guarded secret.

The ancient city of Hoi An is home to one of Asia's oldest trading ports and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A major commercial stop for trading ships as far back as the 15th century, Hoi An still maintains much of its original architecture in the form of timber frame buildings, colorful French-colonial shutters, and Chinese tiled roofs. Religious buildings, courtyards, and shophouses sit side by side on narrow alleyways all across Ancient Town, Hoi An's historical center. </p>

			<h2>Hong Kong</h2>
		<p>Over 7.4 million people from all over the world occupy the small 1,104-square-kilometer island of Hong Kong, making it the third most densely populated place in the world. Despite having one of the world's highest per capita incomes, income inequality has become one of Hong Kong's main issues, and lower-income families often live in crowded tenement buildings. The buildings themselves have become tourist attractions, as many are historic structures dating back over a century.Hong Kong also has the largest number of skyscrapers in the world at 355–an impressive 75 more than the city in second place, New York. A good number of these are located around Victoria Harbor, a popular tourist area with one of the most stunning coastal skylines in Asia.
